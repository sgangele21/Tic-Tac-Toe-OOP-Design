# Tic-Tac-Toe-OOP-Design

Simple Swift Playground to show how I would design the model of a Tic-Tac-Toe Game

**Subject To Change**

Basic Components:
* **Board** - Contains status of board (win, tie, playing), as well as the contents of the board which are n x n squares where each square is  an X or an O
* **Board Logic** - Acts as a mediator between the board and the Player. Purpose is to manipulate the board through actions taken by the player.
* **Player** - Identify who is making what mark on the board, and who is changing the status of the board, as one person must become victorious.
